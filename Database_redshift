We need s3 bucket and IAM role to load data into the table.
create cluster --> cluster name-->db_user_name > db_pass>create
go to query editorv2 > create table > schema public > tablename
load the data from excel as csv file which has data > create table
create role > service redshift > policy s3 fullaccess
In s3 load the excel data without header.
click Load data in the query editor  > sel s3 bucket > sel bucket >
data > ok
schema - public
sel our redshift cluster > Action > IAM > sel our role >save
now in the query editor we will able to sel the role while loading data.
now you can query the data but sel the table and run.


Advantage of Redshift:
It will save the query what ever we run inside it. so that when you try the same query it will retriew
within less time than before.
